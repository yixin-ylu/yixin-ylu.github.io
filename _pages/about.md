Hi there! My name is Yixin Lu, and I am an Associate Professor at the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu). My research examines the broad impact of technological advances on individuals, organizations, and society. I believe research can change the world by (i) improving our understanding of how the world functions, and (ii) inspiring new ideas and methods to tackle societal challenges. As such, I always strive to achieve a good balance between scientific rigor and practical relevance in my research endeavors. My scholarly works have been well received by the academic community as well as practitioners. I am a recipient of the AIS Impact Award, the AIS Early Career Award, the INFORMS ISS Design Science Award, and the Information Systems Research Outstanding Associate Editor Award.
