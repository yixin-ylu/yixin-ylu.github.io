Hi there! My name is Yixin Lu, and I am an Associate Professor at the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu). I work at the intersection of Information Systems, Economics, and Public Policy by examining the broad impact of technological advances on individuals, organizations, and society. My research has shed light on complex dynamics in both traditional markets and emerging digital platforms, leading to practical insights in market design and operations. 

I believe research can change the world by (i) improving our understanding of how the world functions, and (ii) inspiring new ideas and methods to tackle societal challenges. As such, I always strive to achieve a good balance between scientific rigor and practical relevance in my research endeavors. My scholarly works have been recognized by numerous awards, including the AIS Impact Award (2020), the AIS Early Career Award (2021), the INFORMS ISS Design Science Award (2021). 

I have served as an Associate Editor of [Information Systems Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/isre) since 2022, receiving the Outstanding Associate Editor Award in 2024. I regularly review for leading business and management journals and have taken on significant leadership roles including program co-chair and associate editor positions at major field conferences. I have been honored as a Senior Member by [INFORMS](https://www.informs.org/) and Distinguished Member by [AIS](https://aisnet.org/).
